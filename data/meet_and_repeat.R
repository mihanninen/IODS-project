#There are 16 different observations and 13 different variables

#As we can see, there are now 360 different observations and 5 different variables.
#The difference to BPRS in BPRSL is now that every week is an individual value we 
#have that many more observations as before (number of subjects (40) * number of 
#weeks (9) = 360). It is now possible to evaluate the differences in the bprs 
#value between the treatment groups and the possible change of the value in time.

str(RATSL)
summary(RATSL)

#There are 176 observations and 5 different variables in the RATSL data set.
#Similarly to BPRSL before, the difference between RATS and RATSL is that the
#days are now individual values instead of variables, which increases the number
#of observations (number of test subjects (16) * number of days (11) = 176).
#It is now possible to evaluate the differences in the weight of the test 
#subject between the groups and the possible change of the value in time.
